            properly. I am a D3+ student here at BCIT, and currently being mentored by Chris himself. </h2>

            <p>I graduated in 2019 at Steveston-London Secondary School as a honour student. I enjoyed my time there and
                developed my communication and team-working skills with my peers. I also particularly enjoyed my time in
                class with Mr J Mah. He was my Pre-Calculus 12 teacher, he showed us what it took to be a successful
                student in post-secondary. To this date, I still keep in contact with Mr Mah and often visit him. </p>

            <p>I attended Simon Fraser University from 2019 until 2022 whilst studying for my Bachelors of Economics. I
                did not enjoy that program due to the lack of close support you receive from instructors and professors,
                as well as the lack of chances to work with smaller groups and get to know one another better. I decided
                to transfer to the Interactive Arts and Technology program to no avail due to the lack of first-year
                course openings that I was required to take. I then decided to transfer to BCIT instead, and here I am.
